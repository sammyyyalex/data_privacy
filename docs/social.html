                    <h6>Social Media Addiction</h6>
                    Gen-Z spends an average of just under three hours on social media each day, nearly an hour more than
                    the average Millennial. Personally, my highest record of screen time on social media was a little
                    over 4 hours, so I know what it's like to sit down and say to yourself  "only for a few minutes" ,
                    only to suddenly look up and find that you've spent ages scrolling away at your feed or for you
                    page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The truth is, social media is the perfect platform for mass psychological influence. Platforms like
                    Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc., all exploit faults in our psychology to get us to spend more
                    time on screen. It's called "persuasive technology" - tech designed to change attitudes or behaviors
                    of the users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Take, for example, the pull-to-refresh feature. It's present on all social media platforms for a
                    reason. You pull on the screen and you either receive a reward - new posts - or you receive nothing.
                    This is unnervingly similar to gambling on a slot machine; we can't know if we'll be rewarded with
                    new posts, and more often than not we do not get anything gratifying. This precise reason is why we
                    keep coming back and have developed the habit of repeatedly checking our screens.
                </p>
                <p>
                    High social-media usage can lead to phone dependency, and some effects include phantom notifications
                    - thinking our phone is vibrating, or that we have received a message, even when we haven't. These
                    phantom vibrations are linked to our psychological cravings for such signals, and stimulate the same
                    brain mechanisms that usage of drugs like cocaine activate. And the truth is, social media uses you
                    and acts exactly like a drug. And like any constant use of a drug, this leads to addiction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h6>Misinformation and Polarization</h6>
                    57% of GenZ use social media and messaging apps to keep up with the news. And social media platforms
                    are not always reliable sources of information. In fact, they make it possible to spread
                    misinformation with ease, and the algorithms which power our feeds just make it worse. Take, for
                    example, Facebook.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Facebook's algorithms are designed to show you the most popular content that you, specifically, will
                    find interesting. And what is most popular and most interesting, is not always true. And
                    with Facebook's lackluster fact checking and moderation, this meant that anyone who posted
                    legitimate looking content for a non-legitimate Facebook "News" Group, could impact millions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We saw the effects of this especially during the 2016 U.S. election. Misinformation was a very good
                    way to make money, and for a small town in Macedonia, they took full advantage of that. They wrote
                    fake news stories about Trump and Clinton that got over a million shares, likes, and comments.
                    Their false news got more engagement than actual legitimate news stories, because they were the most
                    interesting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But beyond misinformation, Facebook impacted the political landscape with the rise of hyper
                    partisanship. More and more, you saw the rise of Facebook groups that had a "we're right, they're
                    wrong" mindsets. These groups got the most engagement, and Russia took full advantage of this.
                    They launched a Facebook campaign where they'd create ads for Facebook groups that promoted an
                    over-exaggerated view of the opposite side. Their goal was to find populations that were open to
                    those kinds of messages and deliver regular content to them which would further polarize and drive
                    the two sides apart.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One example of this happening in real life was in Texas. Fake Russian accounts created two different
                    Facebook groups: one for rallying Muslims in support of Hillary Clinton, the other for rallying the
                    right wing. One group organized a protest, while the other launched a counterprotest. The result:
                    two opposing groups rallying on the same day in front of a mosque, interactions between the two
                    groups escalating into confrontation and verbal attacks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The fact is, polarization is the model for greater engagement on Facebook, because it means more
                    time spent on site, and the more advertising value you have. Platforms like Facebook are
                    manipulating users, and they have real world consequences. Due to the variance between people's
                    feeds, we no longer see the same set of facts, making it hard for us to share the same reality
                    and agree on what is true. The result is the hyper-polarized US landscape we have today, and a
                    country that is more divided than ever.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a member of Gen-Z and a user of many social media platforms, I find this terrifying. The fact is,
                    social media is a problem, not just because of the way its psychologically manipulating us, but
                    the real world consequences that engagement with these platforms result in. There needs to be change
                    within the tech industry, and we have to be the ones calling for that change.
